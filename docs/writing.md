# Writing Files

## Build the Schema First

The writer is column-oriented. Define the schema, then write one leaf column at a time.

```c
carquet_error_t err = CARQUET_ERROR_INIT;
carquet_schema_t* schema = carquet_schema_create(&err);
if (!schema) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", err.message);
    return 1;
}

carquet_logical_type_t string_type = { .id = CARQUET_LOGICAL_STRING };

carquet_schema_add_column(schema, "id",
    CARQUET_PHYSICAL_INT64, NULL, CARQUET_REPETITION_REQUIRED, 0, 0);
carquet_schema_add_column(schema, "name",
    CARQUET_PHYSICAL_BYTE_ARRAY, &string_type, CARQUET_REPETITION_REQUIRED, 0, 0);
carquet_schema_add_column(schema, "score",
    CARQUET_PHYSICAL_DOUBLE, NULL, CARQUET_REPETITION_OPTIONAL, 0, 0);
```

For nested schemas, see [`nested-data.md`](./nested-data.md).

### Newer Logical Types

Modern logical annotations are passed through the same schema APIs as older types. `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` use `BYTE_ARRAY` storage, and `VARIANT` has a helper that creates the standard unshredded group layout:

```c
carquet_logical_type_t geometry_type = { .id = CARQUET_LOGICAL_GEOMETRY };
carquet_logical_type_t geography_type = {
    .id = CARQUET_LOGICAL_GEOGRAPHY,
    .params.geography = {
        .algorithm = CARQUET_GEOSPATIAL_EDGE_SPHERICAL,
        .has_algorithm = true,
    },
};

carquet_schema_add_column(schema, "shape",
    CARQUET_PHYSICAL_BYTE_ARRAY, &geometry_type,
    CARQUET_REPETITION_OPTIONAL, 0, 0);
carquet_schema_add_column(schema, "region",
    CARQUET_PHYSICAL_BYTE_ARRAY, &geography_type,
    CARQUET_REPETITION_OPTIONAL, 0, 0);

int32_t payload_group = carquet_schema_add_variant(
    schema, "payload", CARQUET_REPETITION_OPTIONAL, 0);
```

When a modern logical type has a legacy equivalent, the writer also emits the corresponding `ConvertedType` compatibility annotation automatically. Footer `column_orders` metadata is emitted automatically for written leaf columns.

## Create the Writer

```c
carquet_writer_options_t opts;
carquet_writer_options_init(&opts);
opts.compression = CARQUET_COMPRESSION_ZSTD;
opts.compression_level = 1;
opts.row_group_size = 128 * 1024 * 1024;
opts.page_size = 1 * 1024 * 1024;
opts.write_statistics = true;
opts.write_crc = true;
opts.write_page_index = true;
opts.write_bloom_filters = true;
opts.write_arrow_schema = false;  /* embed Arrow IPC schema as ARROW:schema (opt-in) */
opts.data_page_version = 1;       /* 1 = DATA_PAGE (default); 2 = DATA_PAGE_V2 */
opts.file_format_version = 2;     /* FileMetaData.version; 1 for very old readers */
opts.coerce_timestamps = false;   /* rescale all TIMESTAMP columns to one unit */
opts.write_batch_size = 0;        /* 0 = automatic internal batching */

carquet_writer_t* writer = carquet_writer_create("out.parquet", schema, &opts, &err);
if (!writer) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", err.message);
    carquet_schema_free(schema);
    return 1;
}

carquet_schema_free(schema);  /* Safe after writer creation */
```

Two opt-in options, both off by default so default output bytes are unchanged:

- `write_arrow_schema`: when `true`, embeds the original Arrow schema as a base64-encoded Arrow IPC Schema message under the `ARROW:schema` footer key, so Arrow/PyArrow recover Arrow-specific type information losslessly. Emitted only for flat (non-nested) schemas and only when you have not already set that key yourself.
- `data_page_version`: `2` writes `DATA_PAGE_V2` (repetition/definition levels stored uncompressed and outside the compressed value region, matching parquet-cpp); any other value keeps the default V1 path.
- `coerce_timestamps` / `coerce_timestamp_unit` / `allow_timestamp_truncation`: when `coerce_timestamps` is true, every `TIMESTAMP` column is rescaled to `coerce_timestamp_unit` (and its metadata emitted at that unit) regardless of the unit declared in the schema — the equivalent of PyArrow's `coerce_timestamps`. A coarser target loses precision and is rejected unless `allow_timestamp_truncation` is true (PyArrow's `allow_truncated_timestamps`).
- `write_batch_size`: caps how many values are processed per internal chunk before a page flush is considered (PyArrow's `write_batch_size`); `0` keeps the automatic page-size-derived heuristic. This tunes streaming/memory behavior, not the output format.
- `file_format_version`: the value written into `FileMetaData.version` in the footer. Default `2`; set to `1` for the very small set of historical readers that reject version-2 files. Independent of `data_page_version` (which controls page format) and of carquet's always-compatible metadata (modern `LogicalType` + legacy `ConvertedType`); any value other than `1` is treated as `2`.

Other writer entry points:

- `carquet_writer_create_file(FILE*, ...)`
- `carquet_writer_create_buffer(...)`

## Write Required Columns

Required columns are straightforward: one value per logical row, no level arrays.

```c
int64_t ids[] = {1, 2, 3};
carquet_byte_array_t names[] = {
    {(uint8_t*)"alice", 5},
    {(uint8_t*)"bob", 3},
    {(uint8_t*)"carol", 5},
};

carquet_writer_write_batch(writer, 0, ids, 3, NULL, NULL);
carquet_writer_write_batch(writer, 1, names, 3, NULL, NULL);
```

## Write Nullable Columns Correctly

This is the rule most users get wrong:

- `num_values` is the logical row count.
- `def_levels` has one entry per logical row.
- `values` contains only the present values, packed contiguously.

Example for logical rows `[1.5, NULL, 3.5, NULL, 5.5]`:

```c
double values[] = {1.5, 3.5, 5.5};
int16_t def_levels[] = {1, 0, 1, 0, 1};

carquet_writer_write_batch(writer, 2, values, 5, def_levels, NULL);
```

You can query the required definition level from the schema with `carquet_schema_max_def_level()` when you are generating levels programmatically.

## Row Groups, Metadata, and Per-Column Overrides

Important writer invariants:

- Every column must advance by the same logical row count.
- Call `carquet_writer_new_row_group()` only when all columns are aligned.
- `carquet_writer_close()` has the same requirement.

Useful APIs before the first write:

- `carquet_writer_add_metadata()`: add footer key-value pairs
- `carquet_writer_set_column_encoding()`
- `carquet_writer_set_column_compression()`
- `carquet_writer_set_column_statistics()`
- `carquet_writer_set_column_bloom_filter()`
- `carquet_writer_set_sorting_columns()`: declare the row-group sort order (written to every row group's metadata; the writer records the declaration only and does not sort or verify the data)

Per-column overrides must be set after writer creation and before writing data.

### Custom Compression Codecs

`carquet_register_codec(codec, impl)` installs a user-supplied `carquet_custom_codec_t` (compress / decompress / compress_bound + opaque `user_data`) against any `carquet_compression_t` slot. A registered codec wins over the built-in for that slot, so this both fills the slots carquet does not ship a built-in for (`LZO`, `BROTLI`) and lets you swap a built-in for an alternative implementation (e.g. a hardware-accelerated `GZIP`). Pass `impl = NULL` to unregister. Registering against `UNCOMPRESSED` is rejected — that path has a no-copy fast lane that must not be intercepted. Registrations are process-wide and not safe to mutate while reader or writer threads are mid-compress / mid-decompress; install codecs at startup before opening files.

### Encoding defaults

By default columns use `PLAIN`, with automatic `BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT` for `FLOAT`/`DOUBLE` columns when a compression codec is set. This favors carquet's fast (near zero-copy) read path; it does not dictionary-encode by default.

Opt into another encoding per column with `carquet_writer_set_column_encoding()`: `RLE_DICTIONARY` (emits a `PLAIN` dictionary page plus `RLE_DICTIONARY` data pages, with automatic fallback to `PLAIN` when the dictionary would exceed `dictionary_page_size` or the data is effectively all-unique), `BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT` (FLOAT/DOUBLE/INT32/INT64/FLBA), `DELTA_BINARY_PACKED` (INT32/INT64), or `DELTA_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY` / `DELTA_BYTE_ARRAY` (BYTE_ARRAY). Dictionary encoding produces smaller files but is slower to read, so it is a deliberate choice rather than the default.

## Column Statistics

With `opts.write_statistics = true` (the default), the writer records per-row-group min/max and null counts for every primitive type — `INT32`, `INT64`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOLEAN`, `BYTE_ARRAY`, and `FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY`. Stats are aggregated across pages and used by `carquet_reader_filter_row_groups()` for predicate pushdown.

`BYTE_ARRAY` min/max are stored using lexicographic order; values longer than 32 bytes are truncated per the Parquet spec (min is truncated to a prefix; max is truncated and incremented so the stored bound is still a valid upper bound).

Type-specific statistics behavior, all automatic:

- `FLOAT16` (`FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY(2)`) min/max are ordered by the represented floating-point value with NaNs skipped, and a zero bound is normalized to `-0.0` (min) / `+0.0` (max), per the spec — not byte-lexicographically.
- `INT96` has no defined sort order, so no min/max statistics are written for it (matching parquet-cpp).
- `GEOMETRY` / `GEOGRAPHY` columns instead get `GeospatialStatistics` written into the column metadata: a coordinate bounding box (`xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax`, plus `z`/`m` when present) and the set of ISO-WKB geometry type codes, computed by parsing the column's WKB values. Regular min/max remain suppressed for these types.

Use `carquet_writer_set_column_statistics(writer, idx, false)` to disable stats for a single column while keeping them on globally.

```c
carquet_writer_options_t opts;
carquet_writer_options_init(&opts);
opts.write_statistics = true;  /* default — shown for clarity */

carquet_writer_t* writer = carquet_writer_create("out.parquet", schema, &opts, &err);

/* Skip stats for one column (e.g. a large opaque blob). */
carquet_writer_set_column_statistics(writer, 2, false);
```

See [`reading.md`](./reading.md#column-statistics) for how to read these stats back and use them for predicate pushdown.

## Append to an Existing File

`carquet_writer_open_append()` opens an existing Parquet file with read+write access and returns a writer positioned to add new row groups. The closing footer is rewritten to list the existing row groups followed by the new ones. Existing bloom filters, page indexes, and key-value metadata are preserved.

```c
carquet_schema_t* schema = /* ...same shape as the existing file's columns... */;

carquet_writer_t* writer = carquet_writer_open_append(
    "events.parquet", schema, /* options= */ NULL, &err);
if (!writer) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", err.message);
    carquet_schema_free(schema);
    return 1;
}
carquet_schema_free(schema);

int32_t batch[] = { /* new rows */ };
carquet_writer_write_batch(writer, 0, batch, sizeof(batch) / sizeof(*batch), NULL, NULL);
carquet_writer_close(writer);
```

What the writer validates and preserves:

- The supplied schema must match the existing file's leaf columns by count, name, physical type, and repetition. Logical-type metadata for already-written row groups stays exactly as recorded in the existing footer; only new row groups follow the current `schema` + `options`.
- Existing key-value footer metadata is carried over. Further `carquet_writer_add_metadata()` calls add to it.
- Bloom filters and page indexes for the existing row groups stay valid — they live between the row group data and the old footer, which is the region the writer overwrites.
- A schema mismatch surfaces as `CARQUET_ERROR_INVALID_SCHEMA` and the file is left untouched.

When this is the right tool:

- Streaming ingestion, log accumulation, periodic snapshots — anywhere you would otherwise read-then-rewrite.
- The footer is rewritten on every close, so each append pays the cost of one footer serialization, not a full file rewrite.

Limitations to be aware of:

- The writer needs read+write access to the file; `r+b` open mode is used internally.
- Existing bloom filters and page indexes are preserved as-is; they are not merged with bloom filters / page indexes you write for the new row groups (each row group's auxiliary structures stay scoped to that row group, which is how Parquet readers expect them).

## Write to Memory Instead of a File

Using an existing schema, you can write to memory and retrieve the final Parquet bytes after close:

```c
carquet_writer_t* writer = carquet_writer_create_buffer(schema, NULL, &err);
if (!writer) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", err.message);
    return 1;
}

int32_t xs[] = {10, 20, 30};
carquet_writer_write_batch(writer, 0, xs, 3, NULL, NULL);
carquet_writer_close(writer);

void* buffer = NULL;
size_t size = 0;
if (carquet_writer_get_buffer(writer, &buffer, &size) == CARQUET_OK) {
    /* buffer now belongs to the caller */
    free(buffer);
}
```

This is useful for RPC payloads, tests, and embedding Parquet output inside a larger container format.

## Failure Path

If any write step fails, call `carquet_writer_abort()` unless `carquet_writer_close()` has already succeeded. `abort()` frees writer resources but does not produce a valid Parquet file.
