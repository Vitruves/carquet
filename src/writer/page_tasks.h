/**
 * @file page_tasks.h
 * @brief Page-granular parallel encode for the row-group finalize
 *
 * A deferred-encode column (see column_writer.c, defer_encode) holds its raw
 * input verbatim until the row group is finalized. For the common flat case
 * (REQUIRED, fixed-stride, PLAIN or BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT, no bloom filter or page
 * index) the page boundaries the eager encoder would pick depend only on the
 * value count, so the stash can be cut into pages up front and every page can
 * be encoded, CRC'd and compressed independently on any worker thread. The
 * row-group writer schedules one task per page across all columns, then each
 * column stitches its pages back together in order. Output is byte-identical
 * to the serial path: same values per page, same code path per page.
